# desinr-lfo

## Overview

This Max4Live device generates LFO (Low-Frequency Oscillator) waveforms that can be mapped to control various parameters within Ableton Live. What sets this LFO generator apart is its unique approach to waveform generation, which intentionally produces imperfect and interestingly broken forms, often resulting in intrinsically rhythmic patterns.

## Features

- Generates a variety of LFO waveforms.
- Waveforms are intentionally approximated with imperfections for added character.
- Easily map generated LFOs to parameters within Ableton Live.
- Lightweight and optimized for performance within Max4Live environment.

## Installation

1. Download the `LFO_Generator.amxd` file from the repository.
2. Place the `LFO_Generator.amxd` file in your Max for Live devices folder.

## Usage

1. Drag and drop the `LFO_Generator` device onto a MIDI or audio track in Ableton Live.
2. Configure the parameters of the LFO waveform as desired.
3. Map the generated LFO waveform to control various parameters within Ableton Live.

# Desinr LFO for Max4Live

## Overview

Desinr LFO is a Max4Live device designed to generate unique Low-Frequency Oscillator waveforms that can be mapped to control parameters within Ableton Live. Unlike traditional LFO generators, Desinr LFO intentionally approximates waveforms with imperfections, resulting in interesting and broken forms that often exhibit intrinsic rhythmic qualities.

## Features

- Control the accuracy of Fourier and Taylor approximations for waveform generation.
- Save and load presets for easy recall of favorite settings.
- Use the POWER control to add versatility to waveform shaping.
- Easily map generated LFOs to control parameters within Ableton Live.
  
## Installation

1. Download the `Desinr_LFO` folder from the repository.
2. Place the folder in your Max for Live devices folder.

## Usage

1. Drag and drop the `Desinr_LFO` device onto a MIDI or audio track in Ableton Live.
2. Configure the parameters of the LFO waveform as desired.
3. Map the generated LFO waveform to control various parameters within Ableton Live.
